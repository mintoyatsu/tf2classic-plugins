# tf2classic-plugins
Fun plugins for your Team Fortress 2 Classic server.

**NOT ALL OF THESE ARE MINE. SOME ARE EDITED FROM THEIR ORIGINAL VERSIONS. THESE ARE FOR THE TF2 CLASSIC MOD, NOT REGULAR TF2.**

You need [TF2Classic-Tools by Scags](https://github.com/Scags/TF2Classic-Tools) to compile the plugins yourself. Otherwise drag the .smx into your sourcemod plugins folder and reload the map. If you want to know the cvars of some of the plugins, just look at the source file.

RTD and Goomba Stomp are at https://github.com/figman57/TF2CPorts
